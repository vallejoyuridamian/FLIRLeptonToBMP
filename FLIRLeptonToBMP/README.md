# Thermal Image 

This program takes the raw data from FLIR Lepton LWIR Micro Thermal camera and converts it to a BMP image. 

There are two variants which use different Celsius to RGB conversions.

It has some useful functions to use, such as conversion from Thermal raw data to Celsius, Celsius to RGB, and all the metadata a BMP file needs to be made.
